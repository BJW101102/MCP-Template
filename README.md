# MCP-Template
a Python starter project for building an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. It includes a server, a client pool to manage multiple connections safely, and a Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to use the tools and communicate with the AI. The project is structured to make it easy to add your own tools, prompts, and workflows. To get started, clone the repository, install dependencies, run the server, and use the notebook to test and interact with your MCP setup.
